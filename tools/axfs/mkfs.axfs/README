How to Build
--------------------
1. "cd mkfs.axfs"
2. "make"

Usage Notes
--------------------
1. "./mkfs.axfs [-h] [-i infile] indir outfile"

 -h         print this help
 -i infile  input file of the XIP information
 dirname    root of the directory tree to be compressed
 outfile    output file


About the Input File
--------------------
The input file is a CSV table containing three values in the following
format:

entry := path,offset,count\n

Path is relative to the root of the filesystem image, prepended
with a . for purposes of later image generation.

Offset is the number of bytes into the file where the 4KByte page to be
included in the XIP region is located.

Count indicates the number of times the page was accessed.

The AXFS Profiling driver will generate a format immediately usable in
the imagebuilder.

CHANGES
--------------------
Aug. 17, 2008

Completed the removal of XML input support for filesystem profiles. The
image builder now only supports CSV table input.

TODO
--------------------
0. Remove test code.

1. Writer will generate a temp image in RAM before writing the output file.
Not sure if this is a problem.  (this is also what cramfs does)

2. Check macro of AXFS_SIZE_WIDTH, and AXFS_OFFSET_WIDTH in axfs_fs.h. These
macros will determine the maximum FS size.  AXFS_OFFSET_WIDTH should be removed.
And verify MAXFSLEN macro in mkfs.axfs.c, since it seems inaccurate.

3. Align file name and data to u32 if needed.

4. Improve the search method of XIP files.

5. The name field of the root inode stores the root directory's path.  But
the path could be a relative path got from command line.  Figure out if this
is proper.

6. Use more efficient dynamic memory allocation for xipfileset[] and
xipchunkset[].

7. Potentially consolidate some CSV parsing functions, or even make them
inline.
