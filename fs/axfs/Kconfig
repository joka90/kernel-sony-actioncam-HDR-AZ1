	help
	  The Advanced XIP File System or (AXFS) is a highly compressed
	  readonly filesystem like cramfs or squashfs.  It also can be
	  configured to store individual pages of files compressed or
	  uncompressed as XIP pages.  This allows for faster boot up and
	  application launch time with a smaller memory footprint.

config AXFS_PROFILING
	bool "Profiling extensions for AXFS (EXPERIMENTAL)"

	  Profiling tooling used to identify what pages in the filesystem
	  image are actually accessed and how much.

	bool "First Mount AXFS as Rootfs"
	depends on AXFS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y if you have enabled axfs, and you want to mount the axfs
	  image as a root file system first when the kernel boots. This option
	  makes the kernel boottime a little faster when the command line is
	  properly set. Before having the kernel mount this axfs image
	  as a root file system, you must pass the command line parameter:
	  "root=/dev/null rootflags=physaddr=0x********" to the kernel
	  (replace 0x******** with the physical address location of the
	  axfs image to boot with).

	  If unsure, say N.

config AXFS_DEBUG
	bool "AXFS debugging support"
	depends on AXFS
	default n
	help
	  If you are experiencing any problems with the AXFS filesystem, say
	  Y here.  This will create a profile entry at /proc/axfs_xip. In this
	  profile, the XIP mapped pages of files are recorded.

	  If unsure, say N.

config AXFS_DEBUG_XIP_RECORDS_NUM
	int "Number of axfs xip profile records (100 - 1000)"

	default 500
	help
	  The number of records which /porc/axfs_xip can record. one record
	  takes about 64 bytes of memory.
